<h1>About page</h1>
<p>We are a group of students who are passionate about healthy dieting amidst our busy lifestyle. A balanced and healthy diet will help enhance a student’s work ethic; students are able to learn better when they are well nourished as studies have shown. Eating healthy meals have a positive correlation to higher grades, better memory and alertness, and faster information processing. One reason for this is that foods that are rich in fibre, protein, and healthy fats keep the body feeling full longer, providing enough energy to focus and stay alert throughout the entire day. Not to mention, food gives energy to the brain, so more brainpower equals better results overall!</p>


<p>As students ourselves, we understand how hard it is to prepare healthy meals without taking too much time. Students generally have a lot on their plate (pun intended), with lectures/classes, extracurricular activities and societies, sports to keep fit and maintaining a good social life. How do you find time to pack meals that are healthy, tasty, and don’t take hours to prepare? We have complied several easy and healthy meals that would help ease into one’s busy schedule, including gluten-free, vegetarian and vegan options as well. We have everything for everyone!</p>
