<h1>About page</h1>
<p>We are a group of students who are passionate about healthy dieting amidst our busy lifestyle. A balanced and healthy diet will help enhance a student’s work ethic; students are able to learn better when they are well nourished as studies have shown. As students ourselves, we understand how hard it is to prepare healthy meals without taking too much time. Students generally have a lot on their plate (pun intended), with lectures/classes, extracurricular activities and societies, sports to keep fit and maintaining a good social life. How do you find time to pack meals that are healthy, tasty, and don’t take hours to prepare? We have complied several easy and healthy meals that would help ease into one’s busy schedule, including gluten-free, vegetarian and vegan options as well. We have everything for everyone!</p>
