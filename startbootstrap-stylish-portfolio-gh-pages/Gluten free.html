<h2>Baked sea bass with lemon caper dressing</h2>
<p>PREP:10 MINS</p>
<p>COOK:10 MINS</p>
<p>SERVES: 4</p>

<h3>Directions:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>To make the dressing, mix the oil with the lemon zest and juice, capers, mustard, some seasoning and 1 tbsp water. Don't add the parsley yet (unless serving straight away) as the acid in the lemon will fade the colour if they are left together for too long. </li>
  <li>Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Line a baking tray with baking parchment and put the fish, skin-side up, on top. Brush the skin with oil and sprinkle with some flaky salt. Bake for 7 mins or until the flesh flakes when tested with a knife. Arrange the fish on warm serving plates, spoon over the dressing and scatter with extra parsley leaves, if you like.</li>
</ol>
