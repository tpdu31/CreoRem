  <h2> Our aims</h2>

  <p>We have created a website to provide University Students with quick and easy to make meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner, with the aim of promoting a healthy lifestyle. </p>
  <p>The recipes we have chosen constitute Vegan, Gluten-free, Vegetarian and Meat. </p>
  <p>These meals are cost-effective, healthy and delicious!</p>


  <h2>Vegan - The New Food Trend?	</h2>

  <p>More and more people are becoming vegan, and has shown to improve weight loss and lower cholesterol levels.</p>
  <p>About 1 in 100 people have celiac disease caused by gluten causing abdominal pain and bloating.</p>

  <br>

  <h2>Healthy and delicious?</h2>
  <P>Our recipes include more fruits and vegetables, as well as beans to provide a source of dietary fibre and proteins. Healthy eating helps lower the risk of heart disease and maintain healthy blood pressure.</p>
